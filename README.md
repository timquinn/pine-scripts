# pine-scripts
 Curated pine scripts for use with the Trading View platform.  

 How to use:

 1. Go into TradingView
 2. Open a chart.  Use BTC/USD as an example.  
 3. Set the chart to a 1d timeframe.  The script works on all timeframes but I've aiming for it to work best on 1d charts  
 4. At the bottom of the chart you'll see tools, one of them in Pine Editor.
 5. Add tqbot.txt to the editor there.
 6. Click the "add to chart" button
